JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There was just one tiny problem though... the collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers were complaining that they were having trouble locating specific reports in this mess of a dataset.

To remedy this issue, I wrote code that created a table dynamically based upon the UFO Sightings dataset. You can filter the table data for specific values. I used pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web page. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

## Automatic Table and Date Search

Created a basic HTML web page using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Added columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comments.

Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

### Multiple Search Categories

Used multiple input tags and select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape

There is no definitive evidence that aliens do exist, but there is also no definitive evidence to prove otherwise. This website explores a large dataset of all reported UFO sightings around the world. Perhaps it will help you realize what millions of people already knowâ€¦
